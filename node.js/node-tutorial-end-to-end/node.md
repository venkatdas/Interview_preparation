## Node 

- event diven architecture
- capable of Asynchrnous I/O  or (Non-blocking I/O)

**History Of node JS**

- wherever there is JS, defintly there is JS engine


## EPI-4
- **Module.export&require**
- By default modules are protected means moduled protected their variables and functions from leaking

- To export multiple modules we have to use object like this
  
```js

module.exports = {sum:sum,

y:y}
```

# EPI-5

- How node executes modules
- the whole file that u have imported so far treats as a function, this func is IIFE.
- like example in a function if u declare a variable and u can not access it from outside, the same way modules will work until u export.

- the above image treated as a function.

-- Reason is, which private access, immediate invoke

- From the  above the require comes from the node js and passes to IIFE as parameters.
