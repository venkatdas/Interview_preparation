## CSS preprocessors


- they are generally interested in your knowledge and experience with tools like Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), LESS, or Stylus.
- These preprocessors extend CSS by allowing you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, making your CSS more maintainable and scalable.

**What is CSS preprocessor**

- A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends the default capabilities of CSS.
- It allows developers to write code in one language (like Sass or LESS), which is then compiled into standard CSS that the browser can understand.


**2. Why Use CSS Preprocessors?**
- Variables: They allow the use of variables for consistent values (e.g., colors, font sizes).
- Nesting: Allows writing CSS in a nested syntax, which mirrors the HTML structure, making the code more readable.
M- ixins: Reusable chunks of CSS code that can be included in multiple places throughout the stylesheet.
- Inheritance: Extending styles from one selector to another, avoiding code duplication.
- Functions and Operations: You can use functions for operations like color manipulation, mathematics, and more.

**Popular CSS Preprocessors:**
- Sass (SCSS): The most popular CSS preprocessor. It comes in two syntaxes, SCSS (Sassy CSS) and Sass (indented syntax). SCSS is more similar to CSS and is widely used.
- LESS: Similar to Sass but with a more straightforward syntax. It was one of the first preprocessors and is still used in some legacy projects.
- Stylus: Known for its flexibility and brevity, allowing the omission of semicolons, colons, and braces.


**How Do You Compile Preprocessor Code?**
- Preprocessor code needs to be compiled into regular CSS before it can be used in the browser.
- This is usually done using task runners like Gulp, Grunt, or through build tools like Webpack, which automate the process of compiling your Sass/LESS files.
