1. ## Output

```js
console.log(foo());
var bar = 'bar';
function foo() {
    return bar;
}
bar = 'baz';
```

- Output undefined

2. If you replace var with let, it leads to reference error

### 3. JavaScript Post-Increment and Pre-Increment Example

```javascript
var a = 3;
var b = a++;  // Post-increment
var c = ++a;  // Pre-increment
console.log(a, b, c);
```


---

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. Initial Value of `a`:
- `a` is initialized with the value `3`.

---

#### 2. Post-Increment (`b = a++`):
- In `b = a++`, the **current value of `a`** (which is `3`) is assigned to `b`.
- After the assignment, `a` is incremented by `1`, making `a = 4`.

**After this step:**
- `a = 4`
- `b = 3`

---

#### 3. Pre-Increment (`c = ++a`):
- In `c = ++a`, `a` is **first incremented by `1`** (pre-increment), making `a = 5`.
- The new value of `a` (which is `5`) is then assigned to `c`.

**After this step:**
- `a = 5`
- `c = 5`

---

#### 4. Final `console.log`:
- The `console.log(a, b, c)` outputs the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

---

### Final Output:
```text
5 3 5
