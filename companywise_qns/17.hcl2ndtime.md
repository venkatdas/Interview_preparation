- What is callback
- "A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a later time, usually after the completion of the operation in the main function. It allows us to perform certain tasks once the current task is done."
- "Callbacks can be either synchronous or asynchronous. In synchronous callbacks, the callback function is executed immediately within the same call stack, while in asynchronous callbacks, the callback is executed after some time, often in response to an event or after a delay (like a network request)."

```js
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + name);
  callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log('Goodbye!');
}

greet('Venkat', sayGoodbye);
```


```js
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Data fetched!');
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData(() => {
  console.log('Callback executed after fetching data');
});
```
