- Asynchronous programming in simple words means doing multiple things without waiting for each task to finish before moving on to the next one.
- Asynchronous programming in JavaScript allows you to execute tasks without blocking the main thread, making your code more efficient, especially when handling I/O operations like network requests, file reading, or timers. This is crucial in JavaScript because it's single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time.
- If a task takes a long time (like fetching data from a server), it would normally block the execution of other code. Asynchronous programming helps prevent that.


- Key Concepts in Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript:
- Callbacks : A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed after some operation completes.
- Promises
- Async/Await
