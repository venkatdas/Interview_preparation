### problem 1

- Given two arrays, create a function that let;s a user know true/false whether these two arrays contan any common items.

```js
// const array1 =['a','b','c','x'];
// const array2 =['z','y','i']
// should return false.
// ----

//const array1 =['a','b','c','x'];
// const array2 =['z','y','x'];
```


----

- the below is one way of doing which has better time complexity.

```js
const arr1=['a','b','c','x'];
const arr2=['z','y','r'];

function containsCommonItem(arr1,arr2){
     let obj1={};
     
     for(let i=0;i<arr1.length;i++){
         if(!obj1[arr1[i]]){
             obj1[arr1[i]]= true
         }
     }
     
     for(let h=0;h<arr2.length;h++){
         if(obj1[arr2[h]]){
             return true;
         }
         
     }
     return false
     
}
```

# Time Complexity Clarification: O(n + m) vs O(n)

## Original Statement
The approach has **O(n + m)** time complexity, where:
- `n` is the length of `arr1`
- `m` is the length of `arr2`

## Why Not Just O(n)?

### Two Different Inputs
We have two separate input arrays that can grow independently:
1. First loop runs `n` times (for `arr1`)
2. Second loop runs `m` times (for `arr2`)

### Big-O Rules
- O(n + m) cannot be simplified to O(n) because `m` isn't a constant - it could be much larger than `n`
- We only drop constants (O(2n) → O(n)), not separate variables

## When Would It Be O(n)?
Only in these cases:
1. If `arr2` had fixed length (but it doesn't - it's an input)
2. If we knew `m ≤ n` always (but we don't have that guarantee)
3. If we were only processing one array

## Practical Implications
In practice:
- When `n ≈ m`, it behaves like O(n)
- When one array is much larger, it matters which one
- The correct, precise notation is O(n + m)

## Computer Science Perspective
This is similar to:
- Processing two separate strings (O(a + b))
- Handling two different matrices (O(rows + columns))
- Any algorithm with two independent input sizes
