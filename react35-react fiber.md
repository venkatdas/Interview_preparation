## React Fiber
- Definition: React Fiber is the re-implementation of React's core algorithm for rendering and reconciliation, introduced in React 16.



Start with the basics of React Rendering:
In traditional React (prior to React Fiber), rendering was synchronous, meaning the entire rendering process would occur in one go. When a change happens, React would update the DOM immediately and block the main thread.
This could lead to poor performance and janky UI updates, especially in complex applications with lots of state changes or re-renders.
2. Introduce the Problem Fiber Solves:
React Fiber is an overhaul of React's core algorithm that helps in handling updates asynchronously.
The main issue React Fiber addresses is improving the user experience by making React rendering non-blocking and more efficient.
In previous versions, React would try to render the entire UI at once, which would freeze the browser during large updates. This is now solved with Fiberâ€™s ability to split work into chunks and prioritize it.
3. Explain How Fiber Works:
Fiber Architecture: It re-architects the rendering process in React. Instead of processing everything in one go, React Fiber breaks down the rendering process into smaller units of work called "fibers".
Each unit or "fiber" represents a single unit of work for React, such as an element, a component, or a lifecycle method.
These fibers are organized into a linked list, where each fiber has references to its parent, child, and sibling fibers.
4. Key Features of Fiber:
Asynchronous Rendering: Fiber allows React to pause work, come back to it later, and prioritize updates based on urgency. This prevents UI freezes and provides a smoother experience.
Prioritization of Updates: React can now prioritize updates based on importance. For example, user interactions like typing are prioritized over non-urgent updates like background data fetching.
Incremental Rendering: Large updates are split into smaller chunks and rendered over multiple frames. This helps in avoiding blocking the main thread for too long, resulting in smoother animations and responsiveness.
Concurrency: With Fiber, React can handle concurrent rendering, which means React can keep the app interactive even when background work is being processed.
5. Benefits of React Fiber:
Improved Performance: By breaking rendering into smaller chunks and prioritizing updates, Fiber improves the overall performance, especially in large applications.
Better User Experience: React can keep the UI responsive, even during complex re-renders.
Smooth Animations: Since rendering work is split, animations no longer get janky and frame drops are minimized.
Improved Scheduling: React now has better control over how and when to perform updates based on priority (e.g., immediate updates for user inputs, background updates for non-essential data).
6. Summarize with a Real-World Analogy:
Think of React Fiber as a manager who oversees a team of workers. Instead of having all workers do the same task at once (causing a bottleneck), the manager breaks down the task into smaller parts, assigns priorities, and ensures that urgent tasks are completed first while background tasks are completed later. This leads to a more efficient, smooth, and productive process.
7. Mention Key Terms Related to Fiber:
Work Units: Each fiber is a unit of work that represents rendering a component or a part of it.
Scheduling: React Fiber uses a scheduler to decide when and how to process each work unit.
Time Slicing: React splits rendering work into chunks over multiple frames, ensuring that the main thread isn't blocked.
