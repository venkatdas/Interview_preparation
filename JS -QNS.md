44. TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE

- The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the period from when JavaScript enters a block (like a function or conditional)
- until it reaches the line where a let or const variable is declared and initialized.
- During this period, the variable exists but cannot be accessed, and any attempt to do so results in a ReferenceError.
- The TDZ ends as soon as JavaScript encounters the variable declaration.
