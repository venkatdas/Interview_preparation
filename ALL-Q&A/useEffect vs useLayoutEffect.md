## UseEffect vs UseLayout Hook ? Which one to use ? Give use Cases of Each


- Both useEffect and useLayoutEffect are hooks in React used to perform side effects in function components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or manipulating the DOM.
- However, they differ in how and when they execute their effects relative to the rendering process.

**useEffect**

- When is useEffect Executed? useEffect is executed after the render phase is complete and the changes have been painted to the screen.
- It is asynchronous and runs after the browser has completed layout and paint, meaning it does not block the browser's rendering process.

- **Key Characteristics:**
- Non-blocking and asynchronous.
- Runs after the paint phase, which means it won't delay the user's initial render.
- Suitable for operations that do not impact the layout, like data fetching, logging, subscriptions, or setting timers.

- **Use Cases for useEffect**

- Data Fetching: Use useEffect to fetch data from an API or perform asynchronous tasks when a component is mounted.


```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const FetchDataComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data))
      .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array to run once on mount

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data:</h1>
      {data ? <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre> : <p>Loading...</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

```

- Subscriptions and Cleanups: Use useEffect to set up subscriptions (e.g., WebSocket connections, event listeners) and clean them up when the component unmounts.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
    console.log('Window resized');
  };

  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

  // Cleanup function to remove the event listener
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  };
}, []); // Empty dependency array to run once on mount
```





**useLayoutEffect**

- When is useLayoutEffect Executed? useLayoutEffect is executed synchronously after React has performed all DOM mutations but before the browser has painted the changes to the screen.
- This means it is blocking and runs before the user sees any visual updates.


**Key Characteristics:**

- Blocking and synchronous.
- Runs after all DOM updates but before the browser paints.
- Suitable for operations that require immediate DOM updates, such as reading layout properties, making DOM measurements, or performing synchronous updates.


**Use Cases for useLayoutEffect:**

- Measuring Layout: Use useLayoutEffect to measure the layout of elements (e.g., getting the width, height, or position of an element) before the browser paints the screen.

```js
import React, { useLayoutEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

const LayoutMeasurementComponent = () => {
  const elementRef = useRef(null);
  const [elementWidth, setElementWidth] = useState(0);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (elementRef.current) {
      const width = elementRef.current.offsetWidth;
      setElementWidth(width); // Measurement happens before paint
      console.log('Element width:', width);
    }
  }, []); // Empty dependency array to run once on mount

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={elementRef}>Measure my width!</div>
      <p>Width: {elementWidth}px</p>
    </div>
  );
};

```

- Synchronously Updating the DOM: Use useLayoutEffect when you need to perform updates or manipulations to the DOM synchronously and immediately after the DOM has been mutated.

```js
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // Direct DOM manipulation
  const element = document.getElementById('myElement');
  element.style.color = 'red'; // Apply styles or manipulate DOM immediately
}, []); // Empty dependency array to run once on mount
```

**Best Practice: Use useEffect by default. Only switch to useLayoutEffect if you have a specific reason to perform operations before the browser paints to the screen. This helps avoid performance issues and ensures smooth user experiences.**
