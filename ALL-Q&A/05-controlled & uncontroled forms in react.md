**Controlled vs Uncontrolled**

1. Controlled Forms


- In controlled forms, form data is handled by the React component's state. React components act as the "single source of truth" for form data.
- This gives you full control over the form data and allows for real-time validation,formatting, dynamic field updates, and more.

**How Controlled Forms Work:**
- Each form element (like <input>, <textarea>, <select>) has a value attribute that is bound to a state variable.
- The onChange handler is used to update the state whenever the user makes changes to the input fields.
